# Code of conduct

As this project is an evaluated group project, we think it is useful to specify some conduct rules to ensure a minimal implication of each
member of our group. Those conduct rules are the following:
1. The punctuality for the working sessions involving our Product Owner and/or Scrum Master is highly expected.
2. The working sessions (daily scrum, sprint review, sprint retrosepctive, backlog refinement and pair programming) will be organised as much as possible outside of the class hours.
3. Members must show a minimum effort to attend to those sessions (especially Scrum related sessions).
4. If someone knows he will be absent to a working session to which he is expected, he must warn the group in advance. 
5. If some work was expected for a working session, each member must have done his work.
6. Members must respect the guidelines described in CONTRIBUTOR.md.
7. The main canal of discussion will be our Discord group. Thus, it is expected a minimum activity on this group.
8. Respect the well-being rules

In case of infringement to one of those rules, the minimum punishment will be the obligation of bringing food for the whole group(caution with different diets) (hint: we have some fries, speculoos and candy lovers...), and in case of heavy infringement or recurrence, the appropriate measure.
